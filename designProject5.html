                                    The problem that we are working to solve involves coming up with strategies that
                                    would relieve some of
                                    the stress faced by visually impaired animals when navigating obstacles, without
                                    risking harm to themselves. Through our research and trials, we will
                                    develop an open-source solution that will enhance their ability to navigate their
                                    surroundings safely and independently, while being cost friendly. Ultimately, our
                                    efforts will aim to improve the
                                    quality of life for visually impaired animals by providing them with effective tools
                                    and support systems.
                                </p>

                                    Visually impaired dogs are not an uncommon occurance around the world. It can be
                                    caused by a variety of different factors such as genetics, old age, trauma, or
                                    medical conditions like cataracts or glaucoma. These dogs face every day as a new
                                    challenge and unfortunately there are not many solutions for them at the moment.
                                    This project delves a little deeper into the current solutions below, but this issue
                                    is very prevalent around the United States but not discussed enough. There is not a
                                    lot of research nor products to help ease the stress of these dog owners and relieve
                                    the dogs of their daily challenges. This project aims to create a solution that
                                    helps to begin a move toward helping visually impaired dogs with cost friendly
                                    solutions that beenfit both dogs and dog owners.

                                    An existing solution that is available in the market is Muffin’s Halo. Muffin’s Halo
                                    is crafted from water-resistant vinyl tubing housing a gauge wire and featuring a
                                    cushioned wing
                                    attachment. Despite its innovative design, the main setback associated with this
                                    product is its high cost, posing a significant barrier for many pet owners
                                    seeking assistance for their visually impaired animals.

                                    Safety Hoop". This offers a more affordable alternative for pet owners, getting rid
                                    of
                                    some of that cost barrier present with Muffin's Halo. Unlike Muffin's Halo, Sienna’s
                                    Blindness Safety Hoop utilizes a harness attachment system rather than a cushion by
                                    the head,
                                    making it more accessible and adaptable for various pets. Additionally, the original
                                    maker
                                    employs PLA (polylactic acid) in its construction, further enhancing its
                                    affordability and sustainability
                                    compared to other materials. The largest issue we found with this design was comfort
                                    for your pet.

                                <h3>The Science Behind It</h3>

                                <p>
                                    The existing solutions help to prevent painful bumps from running into walls,
                                    furniture and other obstacles with a decorative halo to safely alert and redirect
                                    your pooch when she runs into a hard surface. Engineered to be lightweight,
                                    comfortable, and adjustable, both solutions are
                                    designed to distribute the force of an impact in a manner that minimizes harm to the
                                    animal. Muffin’s Halo goes a step further by incorporating cushioned wings to
                                    protect the delicate neck and shoulder area of the dog, while "Sienna’s Blindness
                                    Safety Hoop" addresses the cost barrier, making it more accessible to pet owners
                                    seeking to support their visually impaired pets.

                                    We are aiming for owners of / people who work with animals which have trouble
                                    seeing. We can find potential customers through Tufts Veterinary school.

                                    We are targeting owners of, or individuals who work with, visually impaired animals.
                                    However, due to our limitations of not being able to directly work with animals,
                                    our focus is on learning more about the animals' needs in order to design a properly
                                    functioning, cost friendly, halo design.
                                    To reach potential customers and learn more about the dogs, we plan
                                    to collaborate with institutions such as Tufts Veterinary School, leveraging their
                                    domain knowledge and thier
                                    network to identify individuals seeking assistance for animals with visual
                                    impairments.

                                    We researched some different open source hardware solution that we could use as
                                    inspiration for our project. This reserach included finding 3D Print designs such as
                                    the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4733643">Sienna Hoop</a>, along with
                                    finding a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3686286 ">Blind Dog Bumper

                                    we determined that our product would need the following key features:
                                    <li>Detachability</li>
                                    <li>Cushioned Back</li>

                                    <li>Visor Leveled—allows sight, going up stairs, sniffing grass, etc </li>
                                    <li>Allow eating</li>
                                    <li>Recommend different materials for different dogs</li>
                                    <li>(Maybe) Have a pole attached to the halo</li>

                                    Although we will not be able to use a pet of our own to test our product, to measure
                                    the success of our design, we will employ some testing focused on two primary
                                    factors: tensile strength
                                    and impact resilience. Success will be defined by the ability of the product to
                                    withstand bending forces without breaking, to ensure its durability
                                    during typical usage scenarios of pets hitting stnading objects while running.
                                    Additionally, we will evaluate the product's ability
                                    to withstand impact by testing the speed at which it can hit a wall before breaking
                                    and measuring the distance it bounces back afterward. This testing methodology will
                                    provide quantitative data to assess the effectiveness of the features in enhancing
                                    the product's overall performance and resilience. Testing comfort will be difficult,
                                    but we think that if we find the design to be comfortable, our pets will as well!

                                    In our first meeting we talking about incorpoating the following Designs Thinking
                                    Methods:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Empathize—We talked through the problem and made sure to include humane features to
                                    our design that would allow the four-legged users to still be able to perform daily
                                    tasks.
                                    This includes things like eating from their bowl without the removal of the device,
                                    and
                                    the ease of being detachable. We want to make sure that our four-legged friends are
                                    still
                                    able to live thier lives as they would have with the average 20/75 vision and not be
                                    held back
                                    by this new design. Whether it be the weight or feel, we also don't want the dogs to
                                    feel any sort of
                                    discomfort either.

                                    Prototype—We talked through creating multiple designs and printing them out with PLA
                                    on the Prusa MINI+ in order to slowly improve the actual design before printing it
                                    using our desired
                                    material(s). With these iterations we hope to learn new changes that we can make to
                                    improve our design whlie also addressing any flaws or improvements incrementally. By
                                    refining the design through successive prototypes, we hope to optimize its
                                    functionality, durability, and overall effectiveness before releasing our final
                                    product.

                                    and work to produce an open source hardware solution for owners to have the

                                    Furthermore, we plan to include a notes section offering tips and
                                    recommendations on adjusting the design to accommodate pets of various sizes,
                                    ensuring its

                                    We started working on our solution by printing the Sienna Safety Hoop. Printing this
                                    was difficult as there was a lot of overhang that required support structures. Our
                                    first print was about 90% successful, but there was a portion that did not print
                                    properly. In addition to that, we also felt that the print was much too small to
                                    analyze, so we decided to reprint it at a larger scale. We kept the same supports
                                    but increased the scale; however, this print was not successful. We are unsure as to
                                    whether it was due to our design or the printer itself, so we reprinted the design
                                    using PETG instead of PLA, and edited our design to reprint using PLA agian. To
                                    mitigate the issues we were met with, we added more supports and included a 2 layer
                                    raft that would take up most of the gorund surface of the print. Once we added all
                                    of this we reprinted a third time.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is an image of our initial print which was too small to analyze. As you can
                                    see, there is a section missing on the right side and a lot of misplaced stringing.
                                    It can also be observed that this print is much to frail to be tested on, so it did
                                    not prove to be very useful to us on our journey to designing an assistive halo for
                                    visually impaired animals.

                                <h3>Potential Solutions</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project5/dogForBlindDog.jpeg"

                                    <p>
                                        Although having a halo for a dog can be a great solution, we have listed a few
                                        more solutions down below that could potentially solve this problem as well.
                                        Some of these are reasonable, some are very out there, but they all serve the
                                        same purpose of improving the quality of life to visually impaired dogs.
                                        <li>Get a guide dog for the blind dog-Just as a guide dog can support a blind
                                            human, they can work with other dogs to support them as well.</li>
                                        <li>Lasik-Corrective eye surgery is not made just for humans, dogs can actually
                                            undergo it as well! Generally, if your dog suffers from cataracts, surgery
                                            is recommended and it has a very high success rate of 90% in dogs who
                                            recover their vision</li>
                                        <li>Mini portable fence- Similar to a baby crawler, this would help dogs walk
                                            around without their bodies physically colliding with other objects. This
                                            baby crawler like product would allow the dog to move without the fear of
                                            hurting themselves as there would be a barrier preventing it.</li>
                                        <li>Halo attaches with a harness-This is similar to the Muffin's Halo but this
                                            design uses a harness as well.</li>
                                        <li>Attachable mobility cane-This design is similar to humans using a mobility
                                            cane when they have impaired vision. This would require some trianing, but
                                            once a dog is used to it this could be a great way for them to move about
                                            life. </li>
                                        <li>Really big hat that has a long enough brim-This would also be similar to the
                                            Muffin's Halo design but it would be worn as a hat instead.</li>
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What Did We Learn?</h2>
                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"

                                        <p>
                                            Through this process I was able to learn more about the lives of visually
                                            impaired dogs along with the many challenges thier owners face. There are
                                            too few solutions for a problem this prevalent throughout pets, especially
                                            dogs. Regardless of whether dog owners use a halo or any product of that
                                            sort, there are many adjustments they need to make to make sure that their
                                            dog is able to thrive in a safe and familiar space. There are little things
                                            like consistincy that really helps care for pets, or using their other
                                            senses. Overall, I was able to learn that our solution is only a small step 
                                            within this industry and I hope to hear more about companies in this market
                                            working toward newer and more improved solutions for visually impaired dogs.
