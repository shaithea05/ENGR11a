                                <p>
                                    The goal of this project was to print and assemble a functional hand prosthetic.
                                    There
                                    were a lot of difficulties with printing the different parts of the hand. We used
                                    the
                                    Prusa Mini+ 3D printer and tried printing many times but had difficulties with each
                                    print.
                                    As you can see in the photo above, our initial prints did not fully print and had to
                                    be
                                    stopped midway. We believe it was due to the printer moving too fast on relatively
                                    small objects.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project4/prusaScreenshot.png"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    After multiple attempts at printing the pieces, we decided to add a 2 layer raft to
                                    the print
                                    so that there would be a stronger structure holding the print on the plate. This was
                                    a successful
                                    print.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project4/reprintWithRaft.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    Pictured above you can see our print with the raft going well. Most of our previous
                                    prints had
                                    not even made it this far before we had to pause / stop the print. Through a lot of
                                    trial and error,
                                    and looking at the different settings that we used along with what problems were
                                    apparent, we were
                                    able to finally print all of the pieces of our project. There is a link to the

                                    Once we printed all of our pieces we assembled them all to create the hand, and then
                                    we threaded string through the hand in order to make it functional! This was a
                                    really
                                    fun process and it was interesting to see how it all worked as we were assembling
                                    it.
                                </p>

                                    Starting from the top, once we had all of the pieces shown above, we set up our
                                    station. For us that meant making sure that we actually did have all of the pieces
                                    that we needed and that the supports / rafts were all removed properly (we actually
                                    relized much later that we had forgotten to remove some of the supports, luckily we
                                    were able to find a sharp object to help us remove that part without having to
                                    unassemble our whole project!)

                                <p>
                                    We started by trying to follow these written instructions that were provided, but we
                                    had a tough time trying to understand which piece was what, especially when it came
                                    to the different joints. As you can see, through these instructions it is more
                                    difficult to tell that there are different sizes of fingers that you have to notice
                                    and make sure that they are assembled in the correct order. These instructions were
                                    not bad, they were just not as easy for us to understand, thus we moved to using the
                                    video tutorial (which is linked below, along with the written instructions)
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project4/fingerAssembly.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    We started assembling by assembling the fingers. This was a relatively easy process,
                                    and it made the rest of the project seem like it would be smooth sailing (spoiler:
                                    it was not). One of the issues we had were the prints being extremely fragile. As
                                    you can see in the image above, the side walls of the fingers where the joints
                                    connect is very frail and could tear at any moment. This made the assmebly process a
                                    little more difficult because we had to be very careful but we also had to add a lot
                                    of pressure to make sure the screws went through the areas they had to. It was also
                                    much easier to use the video tutorial for the joints because it was easy to see
                                    which screws were needed as there were many of different sizes. One thing that we
                                    did which was helpful was organizing our materials prior to starting using the
                                    previous image. This allowed us to easily find the pieces we needed when we needed
                                    them.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project4/gauntlet.png" alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    These were two of our easiest and best prints. The palm and gauntlet came out well
                                    on our first prints. Once we had printed the gauntlet we had to mold it to shape it
                                    cylindrically. To do this we used a heat gun in order to make the material
                                    malleable. Once we had the gauntlet heated up we used a mold provided in class to
                                    shape it. There was a slight learning curve, but once we got the hand of it, we were
                                    able to mold the shape pretty well to have a great fit.

                                <p>
                                    This is an image of all of the pieces assembled together. We had not installed the
                                    strings yet to mimic the tendons, but this had the elastics and everything else.
                                    After we had all of these parts assembled, we started with the stringing. This was
                                    when we realized there was no path for the string to travel as we had not removed
                                    the organic supports inside of our prints. Luckily, we were able to properly remove
                                    them and continue strining the tendons of the hand. It was really helpful to watch
                                    the video but there was also a projection of the tendons on the board as we were
                                    working on it that was helpful to look at.
                                </p>

                                    Finally, we added the rubber finger toppers and the velcro to create this functinal
                                    3D printed prosthetic.

                                    This project was really cool to make. I really liked seeing the whole process and
                                    being able to end up with a useable product by the end. I may think about pairing up
                                    with a real customer to create some sort of prosthesis for my final project because
                                    of how much
                                    I appreciated completed this project.
                                </p>

                                    In addition to printing and assembling the Pheonix Hand, we created this
                                    modification of having a magnetic cup holder in the palm of the hand. This is our
                                    sketch of the modified
                                    hand idea that we started with, along with the use of it. This may contribute to an
                                    improved quality of life by allowing individuals to securly hold a few little things
                                    without having to worry about managing them with their fingers. This would also help
                                    prioritize stability of drinks and reduce the risk of spilling, specifically for
                                    newer users who may need to practice using the prosthetic hand.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project4/modifiedHandCAD.png"

                                <p>
                                    Once we had our idea set, we moved onto TinkerCAD and created the design online.
                                    This is a screenshot of our modified hand computer aided design (CAD). We made sure
                                    that the cup was properly aligned with the palm of the hand to ensure stabalization.
                                    Ideally, the magnet would be inside of the filament, so it would not cause issues to
                                    the user; however, there could be problems associated with that if users are not
                                    careful because they could unintentionally connect to other metal objects. So there
                                    are definitely still some things to think about with this modification, and allow
                                    the idea to evolve as different persepctives are uncovered, but it would be an
                                    interesting modification!
