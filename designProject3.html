                                    The goal of this project was to build a Colorful LED Light and measure it to design
                                    two different enclosures for it. The first would be a 3D print enclosure and the
                                    second would be a laser cut enclosure. Both enclosures allow access to THREE key
                                    features: seeing the lights, allowing the microphone to hear, and access to change
                                    the batteries. Although my kit did not end up working, this was my first time
                                    soldering and it was really interesting to see how precise you have to be with the
                                    kit as the pieces are all very small
                                </p>

                                    These are all of the pieces that I had to solder together to make the Colorful LED
                                    Light kit. The following items were included in the kit:
                                    <li> 1 2M Resistor </li>
                                    <li>2 20K Resistors</li>
                                    <li>2 470R Resistors</li>
                                    <li> 1 Microphone</li>
                                    <li> 3 Jumper Lines</li>
                                    <li>12 LED Lights</li>
                                    <li> 1 CD4017 Chip</li>
                                    <li> 1 S9014</li>
                                    <li> 1 100UF Capacitor </li>

                                    In the image above you can see the soldering set up that I set up to work with. I
                                    took out the main pieces of the kit that I was going to begin working with onto my
                                    rubber plate, and had the soldering iron to my right with the vents above me. I kept
                                    the brass solder scouring pad under the holder for easy access and had the actual
                                    solder on my left side. This setup made it easy for me to hold the solder on one
                                    side of the component’s wire and the soldering iron with a lot of solder on the
                                    other side to solder the piece with the PCB Board.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project3/startedWithLights.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    I started my soldering journey with the lights. It was difficult for me to solder as
                                    it was my first time. I thought that I would get the hang of it, but it was much
                                    more difficult than I had expected. There were many times where I had to clean up
                                    the iron because I had kept the solder on it for too long and/or too much solder had
                                    gotten onto it.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project3/solderingLights.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    My soldering was not great, but each of the components were separated and most of
                                    them had not burnt the circuit at this point.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project3/solderingGlob.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    There were many components that I had accidentally soldered together—as you can see
                                    on the left side of the PCB board in the image above—, but I was able to use the
                                    “remover” to properly separate the pieces afterwards. By the end of the soldering,
                                    there were a few parts of the board that I had burnt, but there were also some
                                    really well done parts that looked like tiny Hershey’s Kisses.
                                    Even though my kit did not work—probably due to the burning while I was soldering—it
                                    was really fun to learn how to solder and it is something that I would definitely
                                    enjoy trying again!
                                </p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Project 3 - Enclosures from Scratch</p>
                                <p>
                                    Once I had completed soldering the Colorful LED Light kit, I used a digital caliper
                                    to measure the dimensions of the kit and the battery holder. I have included all of
                                    the images of the dimensions that I measured below—this includes the length, width,
                                    and height of both the electronics kit and the battery holder. This was my first
                                    time using a digital caliper and it took a little while to get used to the mechanics
                                    of it, but once I got it, it was relatively easy to measure. After measuring all of
                                    the dimensions of the electronics kit and the battery holder, I moved onto my
                                    notebook to create my sketches which you will see within the respective enclosures.
                                    When creating my measurements for the enclosures I made sure to round the
                                    measurements up and increase the dimensions by 3mm on both sides of the length and
                                    width, so I had an increase of 6mm in total.

                                <p>
                                    This is an image of my final 3D printed enclosure for my Colorful LED Light kit. It
                                    was my first time creating a design from scratch that was based on measurements, and
                                    it was actually much more difficult than I had anticipated. This was my third print
                                    as the first print did not properly print, and the second print did not properly
                                    close due to miscalculated measurements. There are a few things that I would have
                                    done differently like having a larger fit along with a different design for my
                                    enclosure, but I was happy with my final result as it was able to close and
                                    everything fit well inside. Although my design gets the job done, if given more time
                                    I would have changed the aesthetics of it, and some of the functionality to increase
                                    ease of use. I also dropped my enclosure and a piece chipped off on the side.

                                    The sketches for this enclosure were designed to hold the electronic kit with the
                                    batteries underneath. Using a digital caliper, I measured the dimensions of the
                                    electronic kit, and then to accommodate potential variations and provide a snug fit
                                    with the
                                    snap fitting closure,
                                    I added 3 mm to each side of the enclosure dimensions in the sketch. I could have
                                    used a smaller measurement however, the extra margin
                                    accounts for any print tolerances but also makes sure there is a comfortable and
                                    secure fit for the kit and batteries within the 3D printed enclosure. </p>

                                    This is a screenshot of the lid design that I made on Fusion360. This final design
                                    had an opening strip for the lights, along with two other rectangular shaped holes
                                    for other parts of the electronics kit to be visible. One of the most challenging
                                    parts of creating this design was aligning the openings with the kit so I made sure
                                    to estimate larger instead of smaller.

                                    In this screenshot of the base of the design, you can see the bottom part of the
                                    snap fitting closure that I used to make sure this enclosure would close. This was
                                    my first time working with snap fitting closures but I watched a few youtube
                                    tutorials and was able to properly complete this design. There was a lot of trial
                                    and error when creating the closure, but after a few prints I was able to snap the
                                    top and bottom together.

                                    This is a screenshot of the top of the enclosure sliced in PrusaSlicer. As you can
                                    see, for my final print I flipped the design on its top so that it would have a
                                    stable base and not mis-print like my first attempt. I used the “Place on Face”
                                    feature to rotate the object and make sure that it would print on its top side and
                                    on the plate (instead of above it).
                                </p>

                                    This image shows the final base of the enclosure sliced in PrusaSlicer. This part
                                    was pretty simple once I had the design down. I was a little worried about the snap
                                    fitting closure, but based on my second print I knew that there was a better chance
                                    of it working properly than not.
                                </p>

                                    I used the settings shown above for both parts of the 3D printed enclosure. The
                                    final print was not as clean as I would have liked. There were a lot of gaps in the
                                    top layer, specifically between the infill and the outline, so if I were to print
                                    this again I would change the print settings to be a little slower in order to
                                    minimize the gaps.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is my first print which was incomplete. I printed both pieces of my enclosure
                                    together, but I had the base piece on its bottom and the top piece on its bottom.
                                    This made the print difficult as the machine was printing from the perimeter instead
                                    of the top which had a base structure. Part way through the print I noticed that the
                                    3D printer was only working on the base piece and had completely miscalibrated its
                                    height with the top piece and was no longer able to print it properly. Based on this
                                    initial print, I knew to adjust my next print to lay on the top part of the top
                                    piece to have a stronger base for the print to make sure the printer would not stop
                                    extruding part way through the print.

                                    The image above shows my second print which was able to completely print; however,
                                    the box did not close properly as I had only increased the 3mm measurement on one
                                    side of each dimension instead of both sides, which would have been a 6mm increase.
                                    The kit itself also did not fit through the top piece as there was one component
                                    that could not get through since I had forgotten to dedicate a hole for it. Based on
                                    this design, I increased the dimensions of my design and added another hole to my
                                    design, then I began my final print.

                                    This is my final laser cut enclosure. It is a lot larger than what I had originally
                                    planned in my sketches but I am glad that I was able to get it done. Throughout this
                                    part of the project I had a lot of trouble creating my design on Fusion
                                    360—specifically with the equal tool. My electronic kit fits into the enclosure, but
                                    it is definitely very roomy. I realized much later that for me it was easier to use
                                    my sketches and some math to size the finger joints and translate that into Fusion
                                    360 afterwards, instead of trying to randomly pick values that I would have to make
                                    equal using the provided tool. I enjoyed making the laser cut design more than the
                                    3D print, so I hope to be able to better understand how to make more designs to
                                    laser cut before completing this class!

                                    This is the sketch that I made for my laser cut design. I initially thought I would
                                    use my previous sketch from the 3D print design, but it was difficult for me to
                                    imagine the finger joints being placed in those sketches. After a few tries of
                                    making the design, I created this sketch and it was really helpful when I was in the
                                    design process because it allowed me to have the correct measurements each step of
                                    the way. It was extremely frustrating for the lines to become unequal as I continued
                                    building my design every single time, and even though I do not have the screenshots
                                    of the many many MANY failed attempts that I had trying to create this design, this
                                    part of the project took the most amount of time for me.

                                    These are some images of my final laser cut design in Fusion360. As I stated
                                    earlier, it took a long arduous process to get to this stage, but I’m glad I was
                                    able to. I started with the base sketch and created finger joints on the x-axis. I
                                    followed the tutorial as best as I could and made construction lines from the
                                    rectangular finger joints to each side. Once I had one side done, I mirrored it
                                    across to the other side of the x-axis, and repeated this process for the y-axis.
                                    Once I had the base of the laser cut done, I moved onto making the side pieces. I
                                    projected the fingerjoints and made sure to properly use the negatives to make a
                                    side that would snap into place with the base. Once I had the base done, I created
                                    the left side finger joints by repeating the previous process that I did on the base
                                    with the designated measurements, and then I repeated that whole process again for
                                    each of the sides.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once I completed my design, I exported each of the faces of the design and then
                                    imported them into LightBurn. I had some complications with LightBurn where along
                                    with my designs, the construction lines translated through when they were not
                                    supposed to. Since laser cutting uses negatives and cuts where lines are made, I did
                                    not want to risk keeping all of the lines and instead deleted them to end up with
                                    the final product above.
                                </p>

                                    This is a photograph of the laser cutting process, and I thought it was really cool
                                    to see how fast the laser cutter worked. I had never seen one prior to this but it
                                    looked super interesting how you could see the small flame that was making the
                                    incisions. There were a lot of precautionary steps to get started, but that makes
                                    sense for the danger that could be associated with not following procedures with a
                                    machine like this. If I had the time to remake my design, I would definitely adjust
                                    the sizing of my enclosure. I also think that I would like to come up with a
                                    different design that isn’t just a box to hold the pieces. Overall, this experience
                                    was really exciting, and I’m excited to hopefully spend more time laser cutting.

                                    This project was really interesting to do as it provided a lot of valuable
                                    experience into measuring something and translating those real-life measurements
                                    into a design; however, it was also extremely difficult as a first timer. I
                                    definitely enjoyed the sketching process more than actually using Fusion 360, I also
                                    think that for my future projects I would want to use more time sketching to make
                                    the design process easier for me. I think that the blueprint is super important, and
                                    I would want to try out a few different designs so that I can see what may work and
                                    may not work rather than sticking to exactly what I know would work. I expected to
                                    really enjoy doing a project like this which can be translated to the real-world,
                                    but by going through this process I realized how difficult it actually is—especially
                                    without knowing the software well. Even though it was a difficult process, I ended
                                    up really like it once I got the hang of it and would love to do something like this
                                    again!
