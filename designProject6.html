                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Project 6 - Iteration</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project6/needs.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    After we initially defined our problem and came up with a few solutions, we began to
                                    delve deeper to really flush out our final solution in order to create a
                                    deliverable. This involved creating the following needs statement:
                                <h6>Blind dogs need a way to navigate so that they can be safe and independent.</h6>
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project5/muffinsHalo.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    Once we had our need statement, we moved on to defining some of the Design
                                    Principles and key features that we want our product to address. We defined them as
                                    follows:
                                </p>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Customizable Measurement</b> — We want to be able to measure specific dogs and
                                    customize our design to fit many different dogs
                                    since nose size can vary from dog to dog
                                    even if they are the same breed. We want to include clear instructions on how to
                                    measure the dog
                                    and what to measure to create the best fit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Sturdy</b> —We want the product to be able to withstand forceful impacts, without
                                    moving around too much, and being not likely to break
                                    as the dog moves around.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Removable</b> —We want this produc to be able to come off with some ease if it
                                    gets stuck on something. We do not want to choke or hurt the dog.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Comfort</b> -We do not want this product to cause too much discomfort. Rather we
                                    want it to allow dogs to continue their
                                    way
                                    of life without the product acting as a burden. We expect it to have a learning
                                    curve that allows
                                    the dog
                                    to eventually use the product properly and comfortably.
                                </li>
                                <p>
                                    With these things in mind, we decided that for us success would look like a halo
                                    product that does not break under a heavy impact. In order to do that, we had to
                                    order a few different materials and resources which are linked <a
                                        href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jggXgD1h9Pz74lPPZ1Hh-u_tCgPx0u0ALmFqtUNRgUI/edit?usp=sharing'>HERE</a>.
                                    Once we
                                    completed all of this planning, we moved onto prototyping our product.
                                </p>

                                    Prototyping is an iterative process that involves designing, building, testing, and
                                    refining prototypes in order to improve ideas and identify potential issues before
                                    finalizing a product design. Prototyping allows for experimentation, learning, and
                                    improvement, ultimately leading to the development of a successful and optimized
                                    final product. As we worked toward creating this open-source design, we began our
                                    prototyping process to finalize our Computer-aided design (CAD).

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To begin the prototyping process we took inspiration from the already existing
                                    designs: Muffin’s Halo and the Sierra Safety Hoop. Based on these designs we started
                                    our first iteration and drew a horseshoe-like shape that we would attach to a
                                    harness. This was a very rough sketch of what we envisioned for our design, but it
                                    got the idea across for us to begin moving onto actually sketching it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With our idea fresh in our minds, we moved on to Fusion360 to draw our CAD and print
                                    our first prototype. We had some trouble working with Fusion360, but we used our
                                    knowledge from previous assignments (the laser box design) and created the
                                    screenshot you may see below. We started this design with a circle sketch, and then
                                    extruded it. Once we had this 3-dimensional circle, we cut it in half, and added a
                                    rectangle on its edge. We then extruded the rectangle and added a hole in the middle
                                    of it to mimic the initial blueprint of our product. Then, using our previous
                                    project experience, we mirrored half of the design to the other side of the y axis
                                    to complete our design.
                                </p>

                                    Above is a screenshot from PruseSlicer of our first iteration of the Dog Halo
                                    product. Our first print was pretty straightforward. We used PLA to test out the
                                    design and did not make any adjustments to the settings. We used this first print as
                                    a baseline of our design. We wanted to use this print as something to just see where
                                    we are starting off so that we could determine our next steps based on the successes
                                    and failures of this print.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This initial print came out pretty well. It was very sturdy, but also very bulky.
                                    The measurements were not great, but it had the general shape. After assessing our
                                    initial print, we identified areas for improvement. While the prototype was sturdy,
                                    its bulkiness created challenges in terms of the practicality of our product and its
                                    aesthetics. We realized that we needed to refine the measurements in order to ensure
                                    a better general and enhance the overall design. We also recognized the need for
                                    parameters as we wanted this design to be adaptable to different dogs. Returning to
                                    Fusion 360, we revised our model, incorporating insights from our evaluation of our
                                    first print.

                                    In addition to our inital design, we printed an iteration of the Sienna Hoop to get
                                    a better understanding of a structure that we know works well for a real customer's
                                    visually impaired Pomeranian. With this print we wanted to see what style would have
                                    better functionality for a dog to use. Above is a screenshot of the sliced design on
                                    PrusaSlicer with organize structures. This was the third print attempt that we made.
                                    Although not shown, the first print was done in PLA with no structure and the print
                                    ultimately failed. Our second iteration was also printed in PLA but this version has
                                    some organic structures added; this print also failed. Finally, we tried to print
                                    the hoop with PETG instead, and had a successful result. We really liked this design
                                    with the ovrehead aspect to it; however, when it came down to the testing, this
                                    showed very little promise as it was brittle but also posed a potential threat to
                                    dogs when first using it. We wanted to make sure that our product would be safe for
                                    dogs to use even if it has a learning curve, but this prodcut would have held up to
                                    that standard.

                                    For our next print, in our revised CAD design, we implemented parameters on key
                                    dimensions in
                                    order to introduce flexibility when adjusting the product to different dogs. We also
                                    chose to create a more elliptical shape to optimize the form for aesthetics.
                                    Moreover, we strategically reduced the thickness of the halo component to mitigate
                                    the overall bulkiness of our product, achieving a more streamlined and sleek
                                    appearance without compromising structural integrity. These adjustments reflected
                                    our commitment to continuous refinement and innovation, ensuring that our final
                                    product would meet the demands of both functionality and comfortable aesthetics

                                <p>
                                    This print was unsuccessful the first time as it had fallen off of the magnetic
                                    Prusa plate. After further inspection, we had come to the conclusion that the plate
                                    itself had too many oils on it from people handling it, and we wiped it down with
                                    some alcohol. After prepping the plate, we put it back and reprinted our design.
                                    Unfortunately, we came across the same issue where our design would not fully print.
                                    Based on this error, we increased the width of our halo so that we could reduce the
                                    impact of any collisions. Additionally, we did not have access to a dog that we
                                    could test our product on so we printed a mini dog print along with a mini version
                                    of our improved product.
                                </p>

                                    This is a screenshot of the sliced design in PrusaSlicer with a raft that we hoped
                                    would help the print successfully stick to the plate. As previously mentioned, this
                                    print was much too thin, so we increased the width which helped a little bit.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We printed our own version of a small harness for our mini dog print and used it to
                                    attach the Halo
                                    with velcro. In our life sized design, we planned for the velcro to be tied around
                                    to minimize the chances of dogs taking them off themselves; however with the scaling
                                    of this print, we had to use the sticky aspect of the velcro to attach the Halo to
                                    our dog. We liked this design and felt that it would be sturdy enough to face
                                    different strengths of impacts, but we wanted to try printing another iteration of
                                    our design with curved parts of the ellipses in order to better take the impact.

                                <p>
                                    With this latest print we felt that by making the design have more curves, the force
                                    of any impact would be distributed better and result in less whiplash for the dog
                                    wearing the Halo. Unfortunately, this design did not print properly, but we want to
                                    continue working on improving our design to make a usable open source design.

                                    As shown in the sliced design, there are many gaps within this product as it prints
                                    due to its curving nature. We really wanted this design to work properly or even
                                    simply lead in a positive direction, unfortunately, it did not. With out basic
                                    knowledge of Fusion360 it was difficult to create a design that was 'squiggly' in a
                                    sense and maintain parameters that could be easily adjusted by dog owners that
                                    wanted to print and try this product for their dogs. Even with these issues, we
                                    tried to print this design, but a previously noted (and seen in the image), this
                                    print was unsuccessful. Based on our previous iteratinos along with our end goals,
                                    we decided to not move forward with this design for the rest of the project and
                                    moved on to printing the earlier design using different materials to increase the
                                    tensile strength for dogs to safely navigate themselves.

                                    This project allowed me to understand the real value of iterating through designs,
                                    and how beneficial it can truly be. When we first began this project we had a simple
                                    idea and printed it as it was. Until it was actually printed, we could not properly
                                    decipher the issues and make improvements. With the printed design we were able to
                                    perform tests and see what needed to be changed in order to ensure releasing the
                                    best possible product for these dogs. Without the prototyping phase my group would
                                    not have been able to see the part of our first few inital designs that were
                                    lacking. Additionally, we would not have understood how difficult the printing
                                    process for the top of the Sienna hoop would be without printing it. Prior to
                                    printing it we did want to include that to increase safety; however, once we began
                                    to actually print the product we realized how arduous it would be for users simply
                                    wanted to print it without a lot of prior knowledge. Additionally, the difficulty of
                                    managing the settings to properly print that version to fit a dog's specific
                                    measurements without failing outweighs the saefty benefits that part of the design
                                    would bring. This led us to steer away from that aspect and focus on the halo part.
                                    To summarize, there were a lot of different things that we were able to learn about
                                    how to improve our design for the Dog Halo through the prototyping phase. Whether we
                                    made one small change or completely altered the direction of our design,
                                    continuously iterating through our design had a large effect in getting us to our
                                    final design and is a step that should be used when creating any product to ensure
                                    that the final design is at its best it can be.
